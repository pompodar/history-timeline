The Enlightenment—an intellectual and cultural movement centered in Europe during the long 18th century—fundamentally transformed Western concepts of government, religion, society, and human nature through its emphasis on reason, empiricism, and critical inquiry. Building upon the Scientific Revolution's methodological foundations, Enlightenment thinkers including Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Smith, and Kant challenged traditional authority structures while promoting intellectual freedom, religious tolerance, constitutional governance, individual rights, and progress through rational reform. The movement's political dimensions, articulated in works like Locke's Two Treatises of Government and Rousseau's Social Contract, theorized government as deriving legitimacy from popular consent rather than divine right, while Montesquieu's separation of powers concept significantly influenced constitutional structures in newly independent America and revolutionary France. Enlightenment economic thought, particularly Adam Smith's advocacy for market mechanisms and free trade, established intellectual foundations for modern capitalism. The period's scientific advancements further undermined supernatural explanations while enabling early industrialization and agricultural improvements. Through expanding institutions including salons, coffeehouses, Masonic lodges, debating societies, and print media, Enlightenment ideas circulated within a growing "public sphere" that enabled criticism of previously unquestionable religious and political authorities. The movement's values directly influenced American independence, with Jefferson's Declaration explicitly embodying Enlightenment principles of natural rights and governmental accountability. Similarly, early French Revolutionary ideals reflected Enlightenment concepts of citizenship, constitutionalism, and universal rights. Despite internal divisions between moderate and radical strains, religious and secular approaches, and national variations, Enlightenment thinking established core intellectual frameworks that shaped subsequent political, scientific, and social developments throughout the West and beyond. Its emphasis on universal human rights, the possibility of progress through rational reform, constitutional constraints on power, religious tolerance, and empirically-based knowledge continue to define fundamental aspects of modern liberal democratic societies and international institutions worldwide.
