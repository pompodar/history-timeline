The Protestant Reformation, conventionally beginning with Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses criticizing indulgence sales in 1517, fundamentally transformed Western Christianity and catalyzed profound religious, political, social, and cultural changes across Europe. Initially focused on reforming perceived corruption and theological distortions within the Catholic Church, the movement rapidly evolved into a broad challenge to papal authority and medieval Christian practices. Core Protestant principles including sola scriptura (scripture alone as religious authority), sola fide (salvation through faith alone), and the priesthood of all believers directly contradicted Catholic theology and undermined ecclesiastical hierarchies. The Reformation fragmented Western Christian unity into competing denominations including Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, and Anabaptist traditions, each developing distinct theological interpretations and institutional structures. The printing press proved crucial in disseminating reformist ideas, with Luther's German Bible translation and other vernacular scriptures dramatically expanding lay access to religious texts previously controlled by Latin-literate clergy. Political authorities played decisive roles, as German princes, Scandinavian monarchs, and English kings embraced Protestantism for theological, political, and economic reasons including confiscating Church property. Religious divisions fueled a century of European conflicts culminating in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (ruler determines region's religion) in the Peace of Westphalia. Beyond theology, the Reformation accelerated state centralization, stimulated higher literacy through Bible reading, influenced economic development through what Max Weber identified as the "Protestant work ethic," and contributed to early democratic concepts by challenging traditional authority. The Catholic Counter-Reformation responded with internal reforms, missionary expansion, and institutional revitalization. Reformation-era religious pluralism eventually contributed to concepts of religious tolerance, though only after devastating conflicts demonstrated the impossibility of reestablishing Christian unity through force. The movement fundamentally altered Christianity's relationship with European society and politics, establishing patterns of denominational diversity and secular-religious tension that continue to shape Western civilization.
