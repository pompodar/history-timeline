# The Renaissance (14th - 17th Centuries)

The Renaissance was a transformative cultural, artistic, political, and intellectual movement that began in Italy in the late Middle Ages and spread throughout Europe. Meaning "rebirth" in French, the Renaissance represented a renewed interest in classical learning and values as well as a shift toward humanism, rationalism, and an appreciation for the individual's potential.

## Legacy

The Renaissance fundamentally altered European intellectual life, breaking with medieval tradition and laying groundwork for the modern world. Its emphasis on humanism, rationalism, and individualism shaped subsequent movements including the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.

Renaissance art continues to be celebrated for its technical brilliance and humanistic themes, while Renaissance literature expanded expressive possibilities in European languages. The period's architectural innovations remain visible in cities across Europe, and its political theories influenced governmental development for centuries.

Perhaps most significantly, the Renaissance established a cultural template that valued innovation, questioned traditional authorities, and placed human agency at the center of intellectual inquiry—ideas that continue to shape global civilization in the modern era.
