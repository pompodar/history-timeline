The Hundred Years' War—the prolonged conflict between England and France spanning 116 years—transformed medieval warfare, accelerated national identity formation in both kingdoms, and fundamentally altered Western European political geography. Beginning with Edward III's 1337 claim to the French throne and concluding with French victory in 1453, this intermittent struggle featured significant English victories at Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356), and Agincourt (1415), followed by French resurgence under Joan of Arc's inspiration and Charles VII's military reforms. The conflict's extraordinary duration stemmed from multiple factors: dynastic rivalry after the Capetian succession crisis; territorial disputes over English continental possessions; economic competition for Flanders' wool trade; and recurring truces interrupted by renewed hostilities when domestic conditions permitted military mobilization. The war accelerated revolutionary military developments, including English longbow tactics defeating French heavy cavalry; increased infantry importance; early gunpowder weapons; and professional standing armies replacing feudal levies. These innovations steadily eroded the military dominance of mounted knights that had characterized medieval warfare for centuries. The conflict's socioeconomic impact proved devastating across northern France, where repeated campaigns, mercenary companies, and plague reduced the population by approximately one-third through combat, disease, and agricultural disruption. Fiscal pressures to finance military operations transformed both kingdoms: England developed parliamentary taxation approval mechanisms strengthening representative institutions, while French monarchs established more centralized taxation systems bypassing traditional noble privileges. Perhaps most significantly, the conflict catalyzed national identity formation as propaganda, literature, and shared sacrifice crystallized concepts of "Englishness" and "Frenchness" that transcended previous regional and feudal identities. These emerging national consciousnesses manifested through vernacular literature including Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and administrative language shifts from Latin to English and French respectively. The war's conclusion established France as Continental Europe's preeminent power while redirecting English ambitions toward maritime expansion after losing all continental territories except Calais. This geopolitical reorientation produced two competing national development models: French absolutist centralization versus English constitutional monarchy with stronger representative institutions, establishing divergent patterns that would profoundly influence subsequent European political evolution. The Hundred Years' War thus represents not merely a dynastic conflict but a transformative process accelerating institutional development, military innovation, and political identity formation that fundamentally shaped the transition from medieval to early modern European political structures.
