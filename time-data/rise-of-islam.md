The emergence of Islam in 7th-century Arabia transformed world history. Beginning with Muhammad's revelations in Mecca around 610 CE, Islam rapidly expanded from a local religious movement to a global civilization. After facing persecution in Mecca, Muhammad's migration (Hijra) to Medina in 622 CE—marking year one of the Islamic calendar—established the first Muslim community and political entity. Following Muhammad's death in 632 CE, the Rashidun Caliphate expanded Islamic governance beyond Arabia, conquering the Sasanian Empire and significant Byzantine territories within just two decades. The subsequent Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE) further extended Islamic rule across North Africa, Iberia, and Central Asia, creating an empire larger than Rome at its height. This expansion facilitated unprecedented cultural and intellectual exchange across previously separate civilizations. Islam's emphasis on literacy to read the Quran promoted scholarship and learning, while its commercial principles encouraged trade networks spanning from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Islamic civilization preserved and expanded upon Greco-Roman knowledge during Europe's Early Middle Ages, making crucial contributions to mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, philosophy, architecture, and literature. By establishing Arabic as an international language of scholarship and governance, Islam created a cosmopolitan intellectual culture that facilitated the transmission of ideas across vast distances. The religion's rapid spread and enduring influence fundamentally altered the religious, cultural, political, and intellectual landscape of three continents, establishing a civilization whose contributions remain integral to human development.
