The Aztec Empire (Triple Alliance)—Mesoamerica's most powerful late pre-Columbian state—established sophisticated political, economic, and cultural systems in the Basin of Mexico while developing distinctive religious practices, educational institutions, and urban achievements before Spanish conquest abruptly terminated independent indigenous state development in central Mexico. Formally established in 1428 when the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan formed a triple alliance dominating the Valley of Mexico following victory over the previously dominant Tepanec state, the empire expanded rapidly through military conquest, diplomatic pressure, and strategic alliances to control vast territories from central Mexico to parts of Guatemala by the early 16th century. Unlike European imperial systems, Aztec governance maintained existing local political structures while imposing tribute obligations rather than direct administrative control, creating a hegemonic system where approximately 489 subject provinces maintained local leaders and customs while delivering regular payments of agricultural products, luxury goods, raw materials, and military service to the dominant cities, with Tenochtitlan gradually achieving preeminence within the alliance. The empire's economic foundation rested on sophisticated agricultural systems combining chinampas (highly productive artificial islands created in lake beds), terraced hillside cultivation, irrigation networks, and traditional rainfall farming that supported the Basin of Mexico's estimated 1-2 million inhabitants—one of the world's most densely populated regions. Tenochtitlan's urban achievements rivaled contemporary European cities, as the island capital housed 200,000-250,000 residents in a carefully planned metropolis featuring grid-pattern causeways, specialized marketplace districts, planned neighborhoods (calpulli), elaborate palaces, monumental temple complexes, botanical gardens, public sculptures, and sophisticated aqueduct systems bringing fresh water from mainland springs. Aztec society maintained complex social stratification with hereditary nobility (pipiltin), commoners (macehualtin), serfs (mayeque), and slaves, yet allowed social mobility through military achievement, commercial success, or specialized occupations in craft production and long-distance trade. The civilization's distinctive educational system provided universal basic education through neighborhood schools (telpochcalli) teaching practical skills and civic values, while advanced schools (calmecac) trained nobility and exceptional commoners in history, astronomy, theology, mathematics, and governance. Religious practices featured a complex polytheistic system emphasizing cosmic balance through ritual calendars tracking multiple cyclical time counts, with public ceremonies including human sacrifice—viewed as necessary cosmic nourishment preventing universal destruction through feeding the gods, particularly the solar deity Huitzilopochtli who required human hearts and blood to maintain his daily journey across the sky. Intellectual achievements included sophisticated astronomical knowledge tracking celestial movements with remarkable precision, mathematical systems utilizing vigesimal (base-20) calculation with zero concept, pictographic writing recording historical, economic, and religious information, and extensive pharmacological knowledge encompassing hundreds of medicinal plants. Spanish conquest in 1519-1521 resulted from Hernán Cortés exploiting regional rivalries while introducing devastating epidemics, superior military technology, and cavalry advantages, yet Aztec cultural elements including language (Nahuatl), agricultural practices, artistic traditions, and social organization persisted through colonial transformation, maintaining indigenous identity that continues influencing modern Mexican culture despite the empire's political destruction.
