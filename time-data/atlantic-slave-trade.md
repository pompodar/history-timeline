The Atlantic Slave Trade—the forced transportation of approximately 12.5 million Africans to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries—represents history's largest forced migration and one of its most profound humanitarian catastrophes, fundamentally shaping demographic, economic, and social development across four continents. Beginning with Portuguese expeditions in the mid-15th century and accelerating after European colonization in the Americas created plantation labor demand, the trade evolved into a complex commercial system involving European merchants, African intermediaries, and American plantation economies in the infamous "Triangular Trade" exchanging European manufactured goods for enslaved Africans who produced tropical commodities for European consumption. The Middle Passage—the transatlantic voyage typically lasting 60-90 days—subjected captives to horrific conditions including overcrowding, disease, sexual violence, and inadequate food and water, resulting in approximately 15% mortality during transit alone, with millions more dying during capture, forced marches to coastal trading forts, and "seasoning" after arrival in the Americas. While British, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and American traders all participated extensively, slave destinations varied significantly: approximately 40% were transported to Brazil, 40% to the Caribbean (primarily British, French, and Spanish colonies), and less than 4% to North America, though through natural increase the United States eventually developed the Western Hemisphere's largest enslaved population by the mid-19th century. The trade profoundly affected participating societies: in Africa, it intensified warfare, disrupted political systems, depopulated regions, and altered economic incentives toward predatory activities; in the Americas, it enabled plantation economies producing sugar, cotton, coffee, and tobacco through systematized brutality while creating deeply embedded racial hierarchies that long outlasted slavery itself; in Europe, slave-trade profits provided significant capital accumulation fueling industrialization, while sugar and cotton imports transformed consumption patterns and manufacturing. Despite enslaved people's continuous resistance through rebellions, cultural preservation, and community formation under oppressive conditions, the system's dismantling required sustained abolitionist movements and changing economic conditions, with Britain prohibiting slave trading in 1807, the United States following in 1808, and Brazil conducting the final documented transatlantic slave voyage in 1866. The trade's profound legacy continues shaping contemporary societies through persistent socioeconomic inequalities, racial ideologies developed to justify human commodification, cultural and genetic connections across the Atlantic world, and ongoing debates about historical responsibility, memory, and reparations for this massive violation of human rights that fundamentally shaped the modern world's economic and social development.
