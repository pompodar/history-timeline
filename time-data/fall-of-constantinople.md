The fall of Constantinople to Ottoman forces under Sultan Mehmed II on May 29, 1453, marked the end of the Byzantine Empire after more than eleven centuries and fundamentally altered the geopolitical and cultural landscape of Europe and the Middle East. After a 53-day siege featuring the largest cannons yet deployed in warfare, Ottoman forces overwhelmed the city's defenders despite Emperor Constantine XI's desperate resistance with a vastly outnumbered garrison. This pivotal event eliminated the last vestige of the Roman Empire and established the Ottoman Empire as a major power spanning Europe, Asia, and eventually North Africa. For Eastern Christianity, the loss of Orthodoxy's spiritual center constituted a profound theological and cultural trauma. Thousands of Byzantine scholars fled westward, bringing classical Greek texts and Renaissance-stimulating knowledge to Italy and beyond. The fall fundamentally disrupted European-Asian trade patterns, as Ottoman control of eastern Mediterranean shipping lanes and key overland routes incentivized Western European powers to develop alternative maritime connections to Asiaâ€”directly contributing to the Age of Exploration and eventually the Columbian Exchange. The Ottoman conquest transformed Constantinople (renamed Istanbul) into a Muslim imperial capital while preserving its significance as a global commercial center. Sultan Mehmed incorporated Byzantine administrative structures and protected religious minorities through the millet system, creating a multicultural imperial model. The event heightened European fears of Ottoman expansion while simultaneously accelerating Renaissance learning through the westward migration of Greek scholars and texts. As a pivotal transition between medieval and early modern history, Constantinople's fall represents one of history's most consequential power transfers, closing the classical Roman chapter of Mediterranean history and inaugurating four centuries of Ottoman dominance in Southeastern Europe and the Middle East.
