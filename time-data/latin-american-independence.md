Latin America's independence movements transformed the Western Hemisphere's political landscape, replacing three centuries of Iberian colonial rule with over a dozen sovereign states in less than two decades. This wave of anti-colonial revolution began when Napoleon's 1808 invasion of Spain and Portugal created a sovereignty crisis throughout their American empires, with initial loyalty to deposed monarchs evolving into independence movements as revolutionary juntas formed in major cities. Key leaders including Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín, Bernardo O'Higgins, and Miguel Hidalgo mobilized diverse coalitions challenging colonial authority, though independence struggles varied significantly by region. In Mexico, Father Hidalgo's 1810 peasant uprising initiated a decade-long conflict culminating in independence under conservative Creole leadership. South American liberation featured more organized military campaigns, with San Martín leading forces from Argentina over the Andes to liberate Chile and coastal Peru, while Bolívar's armies secured Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru's interior. By 1826, all continental territories from Mexico to Argentina had achieved independence except Brazil, which underwent a distinctive transition as Portuguese prince Pedro declared independence while maintaining monarchical rule until 1889. The revolutions transformed Spanish America's political landscape from two viceroyalties and several captaincies-general into over a dozen republics, though most initially struggled with political instability, caudillo (strongman) leadership, and economic challenges after independence disrupted colonial trade networks. Despite these difficulties, independence established representative republican governments throughout most of the region, abolished colonial legal distinctions between racial groups, eventually ended slavery, and terminated mercantilist economic restrictions. The movements demonstrated significant ideological complexity, combining Enlightenment principles of natural rights, sovereignty, and constitutionalism with Spanish legal traditions and regional identities. While independence eliminated direct European rule, it maintained economic dependency through export-oriented economies vulnerable to external market fluctuations, while post-colonial societies continued struggling with colonial legacies of inequality, contested citizenship, and regional fragmentation—challenges that shaped Latin American development throughout subsequent centuries.
