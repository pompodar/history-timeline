World War I—initially called the Great War until superseded by an even larger conflict—fundamentally transformed global political, social, and cultural landscapes through unprecedented industrial warfare. Triggered by Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination in Sarajevo, the conflict escalated from a regional dispute into global war through interlocking alliance systems, mobilizing 70 million military personnel across European powers and their colonial empires. The war introduced industrial slaughter on an unprecedented scale, with innovations including machine guns, poison gas, tanks, aircraft, and submarines contributing to approximately 20 million military and civilian deaths. Static trench warfare on the Western Front, where advancing technology favored defensive advantages, created a strategic stalemate broken only after immense casualties at battles including the Somme, Verdun, and Passchendaele. The war's global dimensions extended beyond Europe to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, while American entry in 1917 proved decisive in breaking the stalemate. Beyond battlefield transformations, the war revolutionized domestic societies through mass mobilization of industrial production, expanded state authority, women's entry into previously male-dominated workforce sectors, and unprecedented propaganda campaigns that reshaped national identities. The conflict destroyed four major empires—German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian—redrew the map of Europe and the Middle East through the Treaty of Versailles and associated settlements. The Ottoman Empire's dissolution created new states across the Middle East with artificial boundaries that continue generating regional tensions. The punitive measures imposed on Germany, including "war guilt" clauses and reparations, contributed to political and economic instability that facilitated the rise of fascism and Nazism. The war accelerated financial shifts from European creditor nations to the United States while creating disillusionment that profoundly influenced interwar literature, art, and political thought. World War I's unprecedented geographic scope, technological destructiveness, civilian impacts, and political consequences make it a fundamental watershed between the long 19th century of European dominance and the violent, ideologically-driven conflicts of the 20th century, establishing patterns of total war and global conflict resolution attempts through institutions like the League of Nations that continue shaping contemporary international relations.
