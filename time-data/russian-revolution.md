The Russian Revolution transformed the world's largest territorial state from a backward autocracy into the first socialist regime, establishing an alternative to liberal capitalism that would shape global politics for the next century. Beginning amid the catastrophic strains of World War I, the revolution unfolded in two distinct phases: the February Revolution, which overthrew the 300-year Romanov dynasty and established a liberal Provisional Government, and the October Revolution, when Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks seized power with the slogan "Peace, Land, and Bread." The ensuing five-year Civil War between Bolshevik "Reds" and counter-revolutionary "Whites" (supported by foreign interventionist forces) resulted in approximately 10 million deaths through combat, disease, and the policy of "War Communism" that included grain requisitioning leading to widespread famine. The Bolshevik victory established the Soviet Union in 1922 as the world's first state ideologically committed to Marxist principles, implementing unprecedented social transformations including mass nationalization of industry, abolition of private property, separation of church and state, secularization of education, and early advances in women's legal equality. The revolution fundamentally altered Russia's developmental trajectory, replacing gradual constitutional reform with radical social engineering that prioritized heavy industry, centralized planning, and ideological conformity. Lenin's compromise New Economic Policy (1921-1928) temporarily restored limited market mechanisms before Stalin's ascension brought collectivization and accelerated industrialization. Internationally, the revolution challenged the global capitalist order by supporting anti-colonial movements and communist parties worldwide through the Comintern (Communist International), establishing paradigms for revolutionary movements throughout the 20th century. The revolutionary experience permanently impacted global politics by creating an alternative socioeconomic system that competed with liberal democratic capitalism until the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse, influencing revolutionary movements in China, Cuba, Vietnam, and elsewhere. Whether viewed as a catastrophic derailment of Russia's democratic potential or a necessary rupture with oppressive structures, the Russian Revolution remains one of history's most consequential political transformations, establishing both a governmental model that would temporarily govern one-third of humanity and enduring questions about the viability of revolutionary approaches to social change.
