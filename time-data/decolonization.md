The global process of decolonization—the dismantling of European colonial empires and emergence of dozens of newly independent states—represents one of history's most significant political transformations, fundamentally altering international relations and global demographics of sovereignty. Following World War II, imperial systems that had dominated global politics for centuries collapsed with remarkable speed: the British Empire transitioned from controlling one-quarter of the world's land and population to maintaining only small territories within three decades, while French, Dutch, Belgian, and Portuguese empires similarly dissolved. This transformation resulted from converging factors: colonial subjects' increasingly organized nationalist movements, war-weakened European powers' diminished capacity to maintain imperial control, international normative shifts delegitimizing colonialism, and Cold War superpowers' anti-colonial rhetoric (though often accompanied by neo-imperial practices). Independence movements varied significantly in their approaches, from Mohandas Gandhi's nonviolent resistance in India to armed liberation struggles in Algeria, Kenya, and Vietnam. Decolonization processes ranged from relatively peaceful transitions in some British colonies to protracted violent conflicts, particularly in French Indochina and Algeria, Portuguese Africa, and British Kenya. The newly independent states faced immense challenges including artificial colonial boundaries creating ethnically diverse populations, extractive economic systems designed for imperial benefit rather than balanced development, limited indigenous administrative experience due to colonial exclusion policies, and Cold War pressures to align with competing superpowers. These challenges contributed to political instability, military coups, civil conflicts, and economic difficulties across many post-colonial states. Internationally, decolonization transformed the United Nations from primarily Euro-American institution to genuinely global body, while newly independent nations formed the Non-Aligned Movement seeking autonomy from Cold War blocs and the Group of 77 advocating economic reforms. Decolonization's cultural dimensions included psychological "decolonization of the mind" through reclaiming indigenous languages, educational systems, and cultural practices previously suppressed under colonial rule. Though formal decolonization largely concluded by the mid-1970s with Portuguese African colonies' independence, debates continue regarding ongoing economic dependencies, cultural imperialism, and neo-colonial influences that perpetuate aspects of colonial relationships despite political independence—highlighting the complex, incomplete nature of decolonization processes that continue shaping global development and international relations in the 21st century.
