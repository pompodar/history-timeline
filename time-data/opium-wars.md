The First and Second Opium Wars between Great Britain and Qing Dynasty China fundamentally transformed East Asian international relations and initiated China's "century of humiliation." The conflicts originated from trade imbalances as European demand for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain created massive silver outflows that British merchants counteracted by expanding opium exports from British India to Chinaâ€”despite the drug's illegality under Chinese law. When Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu enforced prohibitions by confiscating and destroying British opium stockpiles in 1839, Britain responded with naval expeditions that demonstrated overwhelming technological and military superiority. The resulting Treaty of Nanking (1842) established patterns of unequal treaties that would characterize China's external relations for a century: war indemnities, forced trade opening, extraterritoriality (foreign immunity from Chinese law), most-favored-nation status, and territorial concessions including Hong Kong. The Second Opium War (1856-1860) expanded these impositions, forcing China to legalize opium, open additional treaty ports, permit foreign diplomatic residence in Beijing, and allow Christian missionary activity throughout China. The treaties' cumulative effect severely undermined Chinese sovereignty while guaranteeing Western commercial access to Chinese markets without reciprocal Chinese rights abroad. Militarily, the conflicts exposed the obsolescence of traditional Chinese forces against industrialized Western militaries, shattering the Sinocentric worldview that had positioned the "Middle Kingdom" at the center of East Asian civilization. Socially, increased opium availability expanded addiction, reaching perhaps 10% of the Chinese population by century's end and draining economic resources. The wars catalyzed internal upheavals including the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), which caused 20-30 million deaths and further weakened Qing authority. The traumatic confrontation with Western imperialism stimulated reform movements and eventually revolutionary nationalism seeking to strengthen China against foreign exploitation. The conflicts' legacy continues shaping Chinese historical consciousness and international relations, with the "century of humiliation" narrative remaining central to Chinese nationalism and Communist Party legitimization, while Hong Kong's 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty explicitly addressed the wars' most enduring territorial legacy.
