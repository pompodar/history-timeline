Christopher Columbus's four transatlantic voyages between 1492 and 1504 initiated sustained European contact with the Americas, triggering one of history's most profound global transformations. While seeking a western route to Asia for Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, Columbus instead encountered Caribbean islands, initiating European awareness of a hemisphere unknown to Old World civilizations. Though Columbus died believing he had reached Asia, his voyages launched the Columbian Exchangeâ€”an unprecedented transfer of plants, animals, technologies, human populations, and diseases between hemispheres that had developed largely independently for over 10,000 years. This biological exchange transformed global agriculture, with American crops like maize, potatoes, and cassava enabling significant population growth across Europe, Africa, and Asia, while European livestock transformed American landscapes. The most devastating aspect was the introduction of Old World diseases to immunologically unprepared Native American populations, causing demographic collapse estimated at 80-95% in many regions. Columbus's journeys initiated Spanish colonization in the Caribbean, establishing patterns of conquest, settlement, resource extraction, and indigenous exploitation that expanded throughout the Americas. The influx of American silver into global markets revolutionized international trade, spurred price revolutions across Eurasia, and shifted economic power toward Atlantic Europe. Beyond immediate impacts, Columbus's voyages fundamentally altered human consciousness by revealing continents unknown to Afro-Eurasian civilizations, challenging existing geographical understanding, and eventually requiring Europeans to recognize the limits of classical and biblical knowledge. The expeditions initiated European imperial competition in the Americas that reshaped global geopolitics for centuries, while creating complex new societies through the interaction and mixing of European, African, and indigenous American peoples. Few historical events have more dramatically altered human societies' economic, biological, political, and cultural trajectories than Columbus's encounter with the Americas, making 1492 a watershed date in global history.
