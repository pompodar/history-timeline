Napoleon Bonaparte's extraordinary rise from Corsican minor nobility to Emperor of France and his subsequent domination of European affairs represents one of history's most remarkable political and military careers. After gaining prominence through military victories during the French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon seized power in the 1799 coup of 18 Brumaire, initially as First Consul and later crowning himself Emperor in 1804. During his fifteen-year rule, Napoleon fundamentally transformed France and Europe through military conquest and civil reforms. His Grande Armée, employing innovative tactics, corps organization, meritocratic promotion, and national conscription, defeated multiple coalition forces and temporarily established French hegemony across continental Europe. At its height, Napoleonic influence extended directly or through satellite states from Portugal to Poland and from the North Sea to Sicily. Beyond battlefield success, Napoleon's domestic achievements proved equally significant and more enduring. His comprehensive legal reform, the Civil Code (Code Napoléon), rationalized and standardized French law while embedding revolutionary principles including legal equality, religious tolerance, and property rights in a coherent system subsequently adopted across Europe and Latin America. His administrative reforms centralized government, established the lycée educational system, created the Bank of France, and developed efficient tax collection, while the Concordat with the Catholic Church healed revolutionary-era religious divisions. Napoleon's Continental System aiming to economically isolate Britain accelerated industrial development in France and parts of Europe while stimulating nationalism in occupied territories. His eventual defeat—after the disastrous 1812 Russian campaign, the War of Liberation in Germany, and final loss at Waterloo in 1815—led to his exile on Saint Helena, where he shaped his historical legacy through memoirs. Though his empire collapsed, Napoleon's legacy endured through legal codes, administrative systems, educational institutions, and nationalist awakening across Europe. His rule represented the revolutionary principles' paradoxical preservation and betrayal—maintaining civic equality while replacing republican governance with authoritarian rule, ultimately establishing patterns of charismatic military leadership and plebiscitary dictatorship that would recur throughout modern political history.
