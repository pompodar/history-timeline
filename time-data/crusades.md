The Crusades—a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church—fundamentally altered relations between Western Christendom, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic world. Initiated when Pope Urban II called for military aid to Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against Seljuk Turk advances in Anatolia, the First Crusade (1095-1099) successfully established four "Crusader states" in the Near East. These Latin Christian outposts in Muslim-majority territories lasted nearly two centuries, with Jerusalem falling to Saladin in 1187 and the last Crusader stronghold, Acre, conquered in 1291. Beyond military operations in the Levant, the Crusading concept expanded to campaigns against pagans in the Baltic, Muslims in Iberia, heretics in Europe, and even political opponents of the papacy. The Crusades accelerated cultural and economic exchange between Europe and the Islamic world, introducing Europeans to advanced Middle Eastern mathematics, medicine, and luxury goods while establishing Italian maritime republics as dominant Mediterranean commercial powers. Militarily, the Crusades contributed to the development of European military orders (Templars, Hospitallers) and fortification techniques. Politically, they strengthened royal authority in European kingdoms, accelerated state centralization for war financing, and contributed to the Byzantine Empire's decline. Religiously, the campaigns hardened divisions between Western and Eastern Christianity while establishing lasting patterns of mutual hostility between Christians and Muslims. The Crusades remain a contested historical memory, viewed through dramatically different lenses in Western, Eastern Orthodox, and Islamic traditions, significantly influencing interfaith and international relations into the present day.
