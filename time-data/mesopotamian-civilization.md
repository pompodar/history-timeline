Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, witnessed the birth of some of the world's earliest urban civilizations. Beginning with the Sumerians around 3500 BCE, this region developed the first writing system (cuneiform), created complex irrigation systems, established the earliest known legal codes, and built the first city-states such as Uruk, Ur, and Eridu. The invention of the wheel, the plow, and mathematical systems for astronomy and commerce revolutionized human capabilities. Mesopotamian religious beliefs influenced later traditions, while their administrative systems provided models for subsequent empires. The region's innovations in writing, mathematics, astronomy, and urban planning represent foundational developments that enabled the rise of complex civilization.
