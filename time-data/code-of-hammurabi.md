The Code of Hammurabi is one of history's oldest and most complete written legal codes, created during the reign of Babylonian King Hammurabi. Inscribed on a seven-foot basalt stele, the code contains 282 laws covering nearly every aspect of daily life in ancient Mesopotamia. The laws address property rights, family relationships, trade, labor, theft, agriculture, and professional standards, establishing a comprehensive framework for societal order. Its famous "eye for an eye" principle introduced proportionate retribution, while its class-based punishments reflected social hierarchies. The code's detailed regulations demonstrate the complexity of Babylonian urban society and the evolution of formalized governance. Though not the earliest legal code, Hammurabi's laws represent a significant milestone in jurisprudence and established principles that influenced subsequent legal systems throughout the ancient world.
