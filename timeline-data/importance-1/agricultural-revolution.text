The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, humanity's gradual transition from hunting and gathering to settled farming, represents perhaps the most profound transformation in human history, fundamentally altering our species' relationship with the natural environment and establishing foundations for subsequent civilizational developments. 

This process occurred independently in multiple world regions: the Fertile Crescent (wheat, barley, sheep, goats) around 10,000 BCE, East Asia (rice, millet, pigs) by 7500 BCE, sub-Saharan Africa (sorghum, millet) by 5000 BCE, and the Americas (maize, potatoes, beans) by 4000 BCE. 

Through selective breeding over generations, humans transformed wild plants and animals into domesticated varieties with characteristics favoring human use—larger seeds, predictable growth patterns, docile behavior, and increased meat production. This transition created food surpluses enabling population growth, occupational specialization beyond food production, and permanent settlements that eventually developed into cities. 

Agricultural subsistence dramatically increased human populations despite requiring significantly more labor and often providing less dietary diversity than foraging. Permanent settlements facilitated revolutionary technologies including pottery, metallurgy, and eventually writing, while growing populations created unprecedented social complexity requiring new governance forms. 

Agriculture profoundly transformed landscapes through deforestation, irrigation, terracing, and pest control, while domesticated species expanded dramatically at wild species' expense. Socially, agricultural societies developed more complex hierarchies, gender specialization, property concepts, and eventually state structures with elites controlling surplus production. The revolution's health consequences proved mixed: while populations expanded dramatically, archaeological evidence reveals decreased stature, increased infectious disease from dense settlements and animal proximity, and dental deterioration from carbohydrate-rich diets. This transformation progressed gradually — most early farming communities maintained significant hunting and gathering alongside cultivation—yet proved revolutionary over millennia. Agriculture's adoption ultimately proved inexorable despite its labor requirements, as farming populations gradually displaced hunter-gatherers through demographic advantages and territorial expansion. 

The Agricultural Revolution thus represents humanity's fundamental metabolic shift from working within natural ecosystems to actively managing and transforming them, creating preconditions for urban civilization, social stratification, and eventually state formation while establishing patterns of environmental modification that have accelerated dramatically in subsequent millennia.
